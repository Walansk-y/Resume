            <h2>Wallys World?</h2>
            <p>Wallys World has been serving musicians at all levels for more than 30 years. Our journey began over spring break when our Web Designer Walansky Richemond, working out of a dorm room with sub-par internet decided to work on his project.Since then Wallys World has grown into the premiere catalog and Internet retailer serving musicians from flutists to tuba players, and percussion artists all alike.</p>

          <ul class="list p1">
            <li><img src="images/HeadShot1.png" alt="" /><b>Walansky Richemond</b> Meet Walansky (Wally) Richemond! Not only is this our founder but he's also the one who created the website! The reason for founding this company was to not only give aspairing and current musicians a platform to find the things they need, but also to get a good grade for his CIS 138 Class. His plans for the future are to forget this website was created and get his degree so that he can get a decently paying job.</li>
