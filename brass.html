            <li><img src="images/3page-img1.jpg" alt=""/><b>Trumpets</b> In nearly every case, the Bb trumpet will be the instrument of choice for any jazz or pop trumpet soloist because of the flexibility to create a wide range of sounds from bright to dark, and loud to soft. Top brands of Bb trumpets include Adams, B&S, Bach and Schilke. You'll find a huge selection of student Bb trumpets, intermediate Bb trumpets, marching trumpets and more.

            <li><img src="images/3page-img2.jpg" alt=""/><b>Trombone</b> The trombone is one of the most flexible and versatile instruments with use in both modern and traditional settings. In an orchestral setting the trombone adds power and intensity to both loud and soft passages. This is essential in balancing the bright/crisp trumpet sound with the low booming tuba sound. The bass section of the Chicago Symphony is a good example of this orchestral concept. Wallys World carries today's top brands including Getzen, Yamaha, Bach, S.E. Shires and more.

            <li><img src="images/3page-img3.jpg" alt=""/><b>Euphonium</b> The sound of the euphonium is very distinct, commonly found as the counter-melody in many John Philip Sousa marches along with classic pieces by Holst. The combination of soaring tone above the ensemble and virtuosic technical ability the valves provide makes the euphonium a double threat both as an ensemble instrument and a solo instrument.
